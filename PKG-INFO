Summary: python/numpy interface to netCDF  library (versions 3 and 4)
License: OSI Approved
Description: netCDF version 4 has many features not found in earlier versions of the library
        and is implemented on
        top of HDF5. This module can read and write files in both the new netCDF 4 and
        the old netCDF 3
        format, and can create files that are readable by HDF5 clients. The API modelled
        after
        Scientific.IO.NetCDF, and should be familiar to users of that module.
        
        Most new features of netCDF 4 are implemented, such as multiple unlimited
        dimensions, groups and zlib data compression. All the new numeric data types
        (such as 64 bit and unsigned integer types) are implemented. Compound,
        variable length (vlen), and enumerated (enum) data types are supported, but
        the opaque type is not. Mixtures of compound, vlen and/or enum data types are not supported.
